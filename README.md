# React Axios Review Lab

Once again, we will be taking something that we have built up in a previous lesson and converting it to a React App with all of the wonderful functionality associated with it


Lets hop back into the Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/) and build up a PokeDex searcher using React. We will need to add in some stately forms for our URL and our data, and keep our Axios call kept in UseEffect. 

Don't worry too much about the style of the app, what is more important is being able to render at least some information onto your screen, after successfully logging a 200'ed call to the Pokemon API

You should fork and clone this repo down and run your create-react-app command inside of it. You will not need an API key or Auth for this
